# PocketFund  
##### PocketFund is a DAPP making use of the verbwire API to provide an open platform for innovative projects and startups aimed at providing social good. Our platform enables small teams/startups to raise necessary funds via crowdfunding through ledger transactions. Pocketfund is completely secure and provides decentralized finance. It employs Solidity for generating a smart contract and ThirdWeb for launching and managing a Web3 project. 

## Tech Stack Used

- ThirdWeb

- Vite

- Solidity

- TailWindCSS

- VerbWire API


## Getting Started (With ThirdWeb)

Create a project using this example:

bash
npx thirdweb create --contract --template hardhat-javascript-starter


You can start editing the page by modifying `contracts/Contract.sol`.

To add functionality to your contracts, you can use the `@thirdweb-dev/contracts` package which provides base contracts and extensions to inherit. The package is already installed with this project. Head to our [Contracts Extensions Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) to learn more.

## Building the project

After any changes to the contract, run:

bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build


to compile your contracts. This will also detect the [Contracts Extensions Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) detected on your contract.

## Deploying Contracts

When you're ready to deploy your contracts, just run one of the following command to deploy you're contracts:

bash
npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy



If you want to release a version of your contracts publicly, you can use one of the followings command:

bash
npm run release
# or
yarn release
