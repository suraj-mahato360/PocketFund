# Verbwire Quickstart Guide

### In this quickstart guide you will see how easy it is to get up and running with the Verbwire API. You will learn how to get your free Verbwire API key, set up a wallet, and test your first endpoint

## 1.) Get your Verbwire API Key
You will need to get your free Verbwire API Key in order to start working with the Verbwire platform. You can sign up for a free Verbwire API key [HERE](https://www.verbwire.com/auth/register)

Once you sign up you will have access to your dashboard, from which you can view statistics and metrics of your interaction with the Verbwire API.

## 2.) Setting up a free wallet
For certain actions like minting, deploying contracts, updating contracts, you will need your wallet address. If you do not already have a wallet you can quickly and easily set up a MetaMask wallet. MetaMask is widely used across many blockchains. You can download your MetaMask wallet [HERE](https://metamask.io/download/)

For more details regarding your MetaMask wallet you can find answers [here](https://metamask.io/about/).

## 3.) Test your first endpoint, without writing any code
Get familiar with testing the endpoints directly from the Verbwire API docs website. The site provides an interactive UI whereby you can actually test endpoints without writing any code. The site also provides a friendly interface that displays sample code in about 20 programming languages, for each endpoint.

Our first simple test will be calling the endpoint that displays attributes for a given NFT.

Steps:

a. Go to the API docs and testing page for this endpoint [here](https://docs.verbwire.com/reference/get_nft-data-attributesforslug)

b. Input _boredapeyachtclub_into the slug field

c. Hit the "Try It" button on the interactive UI

## 4.) Start building!
Need some inspiration? Take a look at sample applications built with the Verbwire API here:

(i) [Minting app](https://docs.verbwire.com/docs/your-first-omni-chain-nft-minting-app) (ii) [Ownership data app](https://docs.verbwire.com/docs/nft-ownership-data) (iii) [SalesData app](https://docs.verbwire.com/docs/salesdata-app)

You can also take a look at the [many recipes verbwire have](https://docs.verbwire.com/recipes), showing how to perform various tasks (mint, IPFS upload, deploy, etc.) in a series of short steps.
